## Key Features

- **Real-Time Hotspots**: Visualize high-demand areas with dynamic, color-coded hotspots (yellow for medium, light red for high demand).
- **Gamified Incentives**: Motivate drivers with tiered rewards (Gold for top 10%, Silver for top 20%) and monthly points-to-credits conversion.
- **Pool Ride Optimization**: Encourage pool rides with real-time notifications and incentives like ‚Äú50% extra earnings for the next 30 minutes.‚Äù
- **Leaderboard System**: Foster healthy competition with a monthly leaderboard and tier badges for top-performing drivers.
- **Seamless Integration**: Modular APIs and lightweight architecture ensure easy integration with existing platforms.
